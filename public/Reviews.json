I'm not a hobbyist and purchased this to take aerial photos of homes that I sell and probably would never operate it higher than about 75-100'. Unfortunately, what isn't mentioned here is that this product has many restrictions called geo zones which render this drone useless in quite a few areas."

The things that are notable are Ocusync 2, 4K video, big increase in wind resistance, and quick shots. As well as longer flight time and stronger propellor motors."

It is easy to fly--I even took it out over water on my first flight, although briefly and controlled in Cine mode. Despite the small, compact size, it is surprisingly stable and takes sharp images, even in some wind."

        "comment": "Significant upgrades across the board when compared to the Mini 1. The main one is definitely Ocusync 2.0, which is a tremendous improvement from the Wifi system utilized in the Mini 1. Everything else was bumped up a bit as well: 4k camera, improved top speed, implementation of RAW image format. It's basically what the Mini 1 should have been."

        "comment": "Be honest I was skeptical about ordering this not from DJI directly. But I’m glad I didn’t because it would have taken so much longer (about 2 weeks) to get this from DJI. I was too excited and don’t want to wait that long and this seller seem very respectable plus if something do go side way I know Amazon and maybe the seller will make it right."
